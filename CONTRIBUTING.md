# Contributing to Feign
Please read [HACKING](./HACKING.md) prior to raising change.

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request (on a branch other than `master` or `gh-pages`).

## Pull Requests
Pull requests eventually need to resolve to a single commit. The commit log should be easy to read as a change log. We use the following form to accomplish that.
* First line is a <=72 character description in present tense, explaining what this does.
  * Ex. "Fixes regression on encoding vnd headers" > "Fixed encoding bug", which forces the reader to look at code to understand impact.
* Do not include issue links in the first line as that makes pull requests look weird.
  * Ex. "Addresses #345" becomes a pull request title: "Addresses #345 #346"
* After the first line, use markdown to concisely summarize the implementation.
  * This isn't in leiu of comments, and it assumes the reader isn't intimately familar with code structure.
* If the change closes an issue, note that at the end of the commit description ex. "Fixes #345"
  * GitHub will automatically close change with this syntax.
* If the change is notable, also update the [change log](./CHANGELOG.md) with your summary description.
  * The unreleased minor version is often a good default.

## Code Style
When submitting code, please ensure you follow the [Google Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html). For example, you can format code with IntelliJ 13 using [this file](https://google.github.io/styleguide/intellij-java-google-style.xml) and with IntelliJ 15 using [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garukun/styleguide/add-intellij-15-java/intellij-15-java-google-style.xml).
